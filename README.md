# what-to-drink

### CSS
We set the width of the Menu Modal to 80vw.  
The original size of the image is 2822×1588, and its aspect ratio is approximately 1.78:1 (2822 / 1588 ≈ 1.78).   
Therefore, the corresponding height of the image can be calculated as follows:
```
height = width / aspect ratio
height = 80vw / 1.78 ≈ 45vw
```
